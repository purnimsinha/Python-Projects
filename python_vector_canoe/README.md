# Introduction
This is the automation of vector canoe project using python script.

# Steps to perform 
<h4> # this is the simple project using vector canoe tool.the main motive of this is to automate the canoe project using python script.</h4>
<li> first download the vector canoe tool(this canoe tool we use in autosar for testing of real ECU with the tool).
<li> after installing the vector canoe tool create one project, in that first you create database and add that database in the
  canoe project.
<li> after that create panel design, create system variable and map that variable with to your components and map those component with
  the name of frames or signals in your database.
<li> after that you have to write the CAPL script for trasmitting and receive the signals form one ECU to other ECU.
<li> after completing all the steps for canoe tool, check in the trace window if the data is trasmitting or not.
<li> after that download canoe library for python, go to command prompt and type (pip install python-CANoe).
<li> open your python IDE and write the code which is given above and run.
  
  # happy coding.
